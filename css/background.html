    <p class="a">I was the demon, the one everyone feared.
You came and showed me what it meant to be vulnerable and strong at the same time.
You taught me what love is, what it means to be cared about,
and how to care for someone, something…

Then, in a flash of light, every single thing in my world collapsed!
Surrounded by the dust and echoes of screams,
I flinched—a drilling pain, a torment that outlived death itself.
I bled and looked.

All I could see was your hairpin,
soaked in the ruins of my soul.
The same one I used to tie your hair…
And this time, it was stained with blood—my own.

And I see you, walking away with a smirk…

I was the demon, then you made me a human,
and gifted me death…
Such a wonderfully twisted fate.
I loved a rose, of the color of blood 
I watered it every day 
Providing water and nutrients
Waiting for the day it blooms with 
A bloody red flower, a rose.. 
As the time passed it showed a bud 
I was excited and curious 
Continue to Nuritioning it 
Then it's started to grow 
Me feeling happy that I was in cloud 9
Then it bloomed... 
Not a blood red rose 
But a yellow tulip
Why didn't I realise the difference
Was I too blind and too dumb
Else this is what is supposed to be from the beginning and I just didn't noticed the difference
The yellow tulip looked good too but it wasn't what I expected
Gusss this what I get
Like the one who loved the sun had to love the sunset as well 
Sunset is beautiful too just like the yellow tulip</p>
